    "This workshop has served as a (very) brief introduction to Matplotlib. There are many software packages which let you plot things (including Excel, Origin, and my personal favorite, Igor Pro), and I am certainly not going to claim that Matplotlib is the best - the learning curve is a little too steep and the syntax occasionally a little too convoluted - but if you want a free, operating system agnostic program capable of producing extremely high-quality plots (something Excel is <b>not</b> able to do without putting a *lot* of effort in), it is very hard to beat. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things that Matplotlib is capable of doing that we have not had time to cover. As with so many things to do with coding, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is an excellent place to find answers about Matplotlib and Python in general. If you think you want to do something using Matplotlib and are not sure how to begin, chances are someone else has already asked the question for you!"
