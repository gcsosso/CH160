    "## 1.1 - What is a function anyway?\n",
    "You may have come across the concept of a function in mathematics (if you have not, or you need a refresher, functions are covered in lecture 4 of CH162:Mathematics for Chemists, part 1), where they are used to describe the relationship - or mapping - between one or more input variables, and an output variable. Often a mathematical function is written as:\n",
    "$$z=f(x,\\,y)$$\n",
    "Where this notation indicates that $f$ is a function which operates on the input variables $x$ and $y$ to generate the output $z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming functions are much more general than this (*i.e.*, we are not limited to the mathematical manipulation of numbers), and the availability of both pre-defined functions and the ability to define and write your own functions is a central part of nearly all programming languages!\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming a function is a self-contained block of code which is designed to perform a very specific task - for instance the in-built ```len()``` function can be used to tell you how many elements there are in a list or array, whilst ```print()``` is the function we use if we wish to print things to screen. In each case we call the function by name, and include some appropriate arguments within the parentheses (*i.e.* a text string in the case of ```print()```), Python then runs the block of code associated with the called function and performs the requested action, before returning to your code at the point it left off.\n"

    "### The beauty of reusable code\n",
    "Often when you are writing code you will perform the same series of operations over and over again. You could simply copy-paste the useful code wherever it is used. However, if you subsequently modified the code in question you would need to make the same modification in every location it was reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution is to write your useful bit of code in the form of a Python function. Whenever you need to use the code you then just need to call the function rather then copy it verbatim. If you later want to change how it works, you only need to make changes in one location - the place you defined your function - and the changes will automatically be picked up whenever the function is called."

Note that just like the loop and conditional structures we met in workshop 3, the ```<body>``` code needs to be indented. \n",

    "The ```return``` statement is probably the part of a Python function that causes the most confusion.
