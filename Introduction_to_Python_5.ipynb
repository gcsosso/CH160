To achieve this numerically we are going to perform a Reimann sum (named after 19th century German mathematician [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann)). In this approximation, we partition (<i>i.e.</i> split) the region under the curve into a series of regular shapes - <i>e.g.</i> rectangles or trapezoids - that together approximate the shape of the curve. We then calculate the area of each of these individual shapes, and finally add all of these areas together to approximate the total area under the curve. \n",

    "The algorithm we have just written is by no means the only way we can numerically integrate functions. While it has the advantage of being very simple, our algorithm requires that we partition our integration regions into a large number of regions in order to produce an accurate result (in the current problem, <i>ca.</i> 3000 regions are needed before the answer in within 0.1% of the true value). There are several other algorithms we could use, and many of these converge far more rapidly - <i>i.e.</i> they don't require the integration region to be divided into as many regions to return an accurate value.\n",

As can be seen in the plot below, for our problem they all converge on the correct answer far more rapidly than the left Reimann sum. The numerical integration code we wrote above can be easily adapted to perform a midpoint rule or trapezoidal rule integration, and implementation of Simpson's rule is only slightly more challenging.\n",

    "## 3. Solving Differential Equations Numerically\n",
    "The final numerical approximation method we shall discuss is the forward Euler method for solving differential equations. This was first reported in 1768 by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) and is the simplest numerical method for solving first-order differential equations (<i>i.e.</i> we don't ever need to calculate the analytical solution) with given intitial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The theory\n",
    "A general first-order differential equation can be written in the form:\n",
    "    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}=f(x,y)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are an infinite number of solutions to this differential equation depending upon the initial values of $x$ and $y$. In order to determine a <i>specific solution</i>, we also need to specify these <i>initial values</i>:\n",
    "    $$y(x_{0})=y_{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have these initial values ($x_{0},\\,y_{0}$), we can use an iterative procedure to generate all subsequent ($x_{n},\\,y_{n}$) pairs:\n",
    "   $$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "            x_{n+1}&=x_{n}+h\\\\\n",

    "       \\end{align*}$$\n",
    "       \n",
    "where, as with the numerical differentiation and integration examples above, the parameter $h$ is a user-defined step size which plays a crucial role in the overall accuracy of the method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [derivation of this result](http://calculuslab.deltacollege.edu/ODE/7-C-1/7-C-1-h-a.html) isn't terribly important to us, but is fairly easy to understand and well worth looking at when you have the time.\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",

    "$$A\\xrightarrow{k} B$$\n",
