To keep track of the running sum we use a variable known as an *accumulator* (for the purposes of this example we shall call this variable ```running_total```, but any name will do). Initially we set the value ```running_total = 0``` because no numbers have been added to it yet. Next we update the value of the accumulator by adding the first number, ```running_total + 1 = 1```. Then we add the next number, 3, and update the accumulator accordingly - ```running_total + 3 = 4```. We repeat this process until we have added the final number to the accumulator. \n",
